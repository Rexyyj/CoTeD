# YOLO v3 implementation

For the implementation details, please refer to the repository: <https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3/tree/master>

## Customizations
We have made some customization on the original implementation to fulfill our requirements, listed as following:
* ```models_split_tiny.py```: We added selectors to simply split the YOLOv3-tiny model.
* ```models_split_large.py```: We added selectors to simply split the YOLOv3 model.

## Notes
* Please follow the description in the original repository to fine-tune models for different datasets.
